Supported SQL Structure:

select $col_name1, $col_name2, ... from a [join b on $col_name3=$col_name4] [where $col_name5=$constant_int


All expressions conform to:
1. col name
2. equal operand
3. constant int


Physical Plan Optimization should have:
1. predicate(filter) push down
2. predicate push to pseudo-storage layer


Input File Format:
All table data place like: file:///tmp/tbl_{table_name}.data
Format: row-oriented, (integer) data is splitted by one space
Meta data place is: file:///tmp/db.tables
One row denoted one table, format is like follow:
tableA: a b c
whichi means a named table: tableA has three columns a, b, c.
Since we only support int, they are implicit of integer type.
